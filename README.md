# Code Quality



**Code Quality** is a platform to track and visualize testing code coverage during your entire development cycle. 
So you can easily see all changes and trends.

Why tracking and visualizing your test coverage results?
* It allows seamless cooperation between Team members.
* Develop with confidence that your code is covered.
* There might be an entire area of your application that is no cover with your test. If you don't see it you don't know it
* Track all Branches in your project.
* Clearly see every commit and its essential data.
* takes the pain out of tracking your code coverage.

**Code Quality** is an isomorphic app built using Mongo, Express, React, Material-UI, NodeJS and Socket.IO for real time updates.
